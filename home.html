              <p class= "about">	This is where I would normally tell about my exploits; how I was once a young, little designer who has turned into a butterfly. So the thing is, I donâ€™t enjoy talking about myself. I would rather have others do the talking and I just show what I can do. However, I will try my best.</p>
              <p class= "about">	I went to college at California State University, Fresno and got my BA in Graphic Design. It was shortly thereafter that I started working for a local awards company. I would make designs for any number of things, such as lapel pins, glassware, trophies, and jewelry. Some clients that I have worked with include Shriners International and Fresno Unified School District. During this time of my life, I increased my vector art abilities substantially. </p>
              <p class= "about">  I enjoy using programs such as Adobe Illustrator and Inkscape to create vector art. I also think that everything should be in vectors; the colors are impeccable and the ability to scale the art without loss of clarity is a plus.</p>
              <p class= "about">	Currently, I am learning how to make websites using html/css and bootstrap. Also I am learning mathematics and I hope to become a mathematician one day.</p>
              <p class= "about">  Please feel free to take a look at my portfolio. It is something I am a little proud of and like to show to all my friends.</p>
